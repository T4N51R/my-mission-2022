        <h3>About the App</h3>
        <p>Fantasy cricket means where a person can make his own eleven taking best player from both side. And then get
            points according to their performance. As a fan of cricket I always look for fantasy cricket app/website.
            But unfortunately, I didn't find any good website. That's why I decided to make a app for my own and others
            cricket lovers..</p>
